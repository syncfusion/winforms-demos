<p>It is possible to convert a valid XHTML content to Word Document content. The passed content should be either XHTML 1.0 or 1.1 compliant.</p><p></p>
<p><font color='#000000' size='2'><b>XHTML 1.1 Transitional</b></font></p><p>It is the same as HTML 4.01 Transitional, but it follows XML syntax rules. It supports everything found in XHTML 1.0 Strict, but also permits the use of a number of elements and attributes that are judged presentational, in order to ease the transition from HTML 3.2 and earlier.  </p>
