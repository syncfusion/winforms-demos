Essential XlsIO is a .NET library that can read and write Microsoft Excel files (BIFF 8 format). It features a full fledged object model just like the Microsoft Office COM libraries. It does not use COM interop and is built from scratch in C#. It can be used on systems that do not have Microsoft Excel installed, making it an excellent report engine for tabular data.
